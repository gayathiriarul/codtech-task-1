## OVERVIEW MY PROJECT OF API INTEGRATION AND DATA VISUALIZATION ##

Project Overview: API Integration and Data Visualization

The API Integration and Data Visualization project demonstrates how Python can be used to fetch real-time data from a public API and represent it visually for better understanding and analysis.

In this project, a public API such as OpenWeatherMap is integrated using Python. The API provides real-time weather information including temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure for a selected city. The data is fetched using the requests library and processed in Python.

After retrieving the data, data visualization techniques are applied using libraries such as Matplotlib (or Seaborn). The weather parameters are displayed in the form of graphs, making the data easy to interpret and analyze.
